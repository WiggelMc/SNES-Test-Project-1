you can skip adding the config to atom and installing packages by installing atom portable (download zip from github)
"https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/v1.60.0"

Directories
  atom
    portable
      atom.exe, ...
    .atom (copy from this folder)

These steps are still required
  +duplicate "atom-build-make.lnk" as "atom-build-make-p.lnk" in same folder
  +change "Start in" Path of "atom-build-make-p.lnk" to Project Directory
